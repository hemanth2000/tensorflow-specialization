# Notes on Advanced Computer Vision

### Intro
Computer Vision (CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (A.I) that solves problem related to digital images. Most basic problem of the computer vision is the image classification of dog/cat. There are different kinds of problems such as binary classification, multi classification, multi-label classification, object localization, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation. It is important to know the difference among these problems.
